If you have an extremely busy scheduele, this project may be useful for you. It's easy to neglect our plants, but by implementing this code with a few sensors and actuators, you can automate plant watering to where you never have to worry about your plants being dehydrated!

(coding concpet #1)
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


(coding conept #2)
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
