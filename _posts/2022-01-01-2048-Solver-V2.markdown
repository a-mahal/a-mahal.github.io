# Description of Game/Rules
2048 is sliding block puzzle game developed by Gabriele Cirulli. It’s a game played on
a 4x4 grid with tiles numbered 2n where ‘n’ represents a natural number. The objective
of the game is to combine tiles of the same number to eventually form the number 2048.
The user can move in the four cardinal directions and after every move a new tile is
generated randomly in the grid which is either numbered 2 or 4 with a probability of
about .10. A move is legal if at least one tile can be slid into an empty spot or if the tiles
can be combined in the chosen direction. The game ends when the user does not have
any legal moves left.

# Mechanical Arm Print and Components 

Check out this pubic [stl file] [stl-file] used to print the comonents of the arm. 

Additional components for this build include the following
- 3x MG995/996R servo motor 
- 3x SG90 servo motor
- 6x M5-0.5 16mm bolt
- 6x M5-0.5 nut 

# Code for Automation
The direct link to the full code can be found (here). There are various ways this arm can be automated based on what you want to accomplish. Belows shows  afew key details on how to program a coaster that automatically throws your can/bottle away for you.
