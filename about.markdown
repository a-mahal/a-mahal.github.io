![Headshot9](/assets/IMG2.png "Hello!")

My name is Arjun Mahal and I am a Mechanical Engineer from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was born in Warren, NJ and currently reside in Washington, DC. I work as an Energy and Sustainability Consultant for Guidehouse and enjoy experimenting with code and mechatronics in my spare time. 

My job and hobbies include:
- Full Stack Development: Continuing my education in this field through various certifications from accredited platforms 
- Fusion 360: Software used to create 3D renderings which I use to print on my Ender 3 V2 printer
