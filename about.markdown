My name is Arjun Mahal and I am a Mechanical Engineer from the University of Maryland, College Park. I was born in Warren, NJ and currently reside in Washington, DC. I work as a HVAC Automation Specialist for Siemens Industry and enjoy experimenting with code and mechatronics in my spare time. 

My job and hobbies include:
- PPCL: Siemens proprietary coding language used to automate HVAC systems for commercial buildings     ranging from variable airlfow volum boxees to boilers and chillers 
- Fusion 360: Software used to create 3D renderings which I used to print on my Ender 3 V2 printer
